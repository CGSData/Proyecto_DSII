Video Games				  
This project involves a comprehensive data science study conducted on a dataset of video games. The dataset includes the following columns:

* Title: Name of each game, including DLC and different versions of the same game.
* Release Date: Date of release.
* Team: Development team.
* Rating: Score given by players.
* Times Listed: Number of users who added the game to their list.
* Number of Reviews: Number of reviews.
* Genres: Genres.
* Summary: Summary of what the game is about.
* Reviews: Some reviews given by users.
* Plays: Number of times the game has been played.
* Playing: Number of active players at the time of data collection.
* Backlogs: Number of users who have the game but have not started it yet.
* Wishlist: Number of users who added the game to their wishlist.

Objectives                        
The main objectives of this analysis are:
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data type conversions, and standardizing the dataset for analysis.
* Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing and visualizing key statistics of the dataset.
* Trend Analysis: Identifying trends in video game ratings and popularity over the years.
* Correlation Analysis: Exploring relationships between different variables, such as ratings and the number of times played.
* Predictive Modeling: Use of predictive models like RandomForestRegressor and LGBMRegressor to predict key variables.
* Cross-Validation: Application of the K-Fold cross-validation method to evaluate the generalization ability of the models.
* Hyperparameter Optimization: Optimization of the models using Randomized Search to enhance their performance.

Tools and Technologies
* Python: For data analysis and visualization.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
* Scikit-learn: For predictive modeling, cross-validation, and hyperparameter optimization.
* LazyPredict: For quickly benchmarking various machine learning models.

Conclusion           
This project provides valuable insights into the video game industry, highlighting key trends and correlations that can inform future game development and marketing strategies.
